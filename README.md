# One-step-chat-application-on-your-Linux-server

Make your linux server act as an instant chat application
I have written a puppet script when installed, if you directly open the ipaddress of linux machine, you are into the chat application.

1. Install puppet
  
  ```  sudo yum -y install puppet ```
  
2. Apply install.pp file

  ```  sudo puppet apply install.pp ```
